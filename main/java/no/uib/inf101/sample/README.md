finely developed functionality over quantity, but, oh well, here we are. 

Blood, Steel, Glory is a turn based strategy game inspired by the civilization series.
Although many features were cut due to time, there is a lot of functionality present still. 
The game map is a generated noisemap. I have functions dedicated to generating new maps,
and two additional tribes in the files, so it would be easy to make a method for generating 
new and even bigger games. 

I had an attempt at making borders around cities so you could grow them passively and
use the terrain you conquer, but it didn't work unforunately.

I will admit, maybe stupidly, that there is an error that appears when you launch the game.
The error appeared after I introduced threads and I could not find the cause,
but the game works as intended. 

Sound is better left to the imagination, don't you think?

Game loops are inspired by this Youtube video:

Unfortunately I could not figure out how to make buttons work with the mouse 
in the game, so you will have to use your keyboard.

    ------ HOW TO PLAY: ------

    Your cities will produce units. 
    Use them to attack the enemy's city.

    Units will automatically heal if turn ends and they have a 
    movement point left.

    Cities will heal a bit every turn if damaged.

    Victory is achieved if you conquer the enemy's city.

CONTROLS:

    ------ IN MENU: ------
    ARROW UP/ DOWN - Navigate in Menu.
